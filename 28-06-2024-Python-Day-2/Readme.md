# Python Programming Concepts

This repository contains explanations and examples of various Python programming concepts that I have learned, including string manipulation, functions, sets, tuples, and dictionaries.

## String Manipulation

String manipulation involves various techniques to handle and modify strings in Python. Key operations include concatenation, finding the length of a string, replacing substrings, counting characters, and splitting strings into lists.

### Key Concepts:
- **String Concatenation:** Joining two or more strings end-to-end.
  ```python
  str1 = "Hello"
  str2 = "World"
  result = str1 + " " + str2  # "Hello World"
  ```

- **Finding Length:** Using the `len()` function to get the number of characters in a string.
  ```python
  my_string = "Hello"
  length = len(my_string)  # 5
  ```

- **Replacing Substrings:** Using the `replace()` method to substitute a part of the string with another string.
  ```python
  my_string = "Hello World"
  new_string = my_string.replace("World", "Python")  # "Hello Python"
  ```

- **String Methods:** Various methods such as `count()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, etc., to manipulate strings.
  ```python
  my_string = "Hello World"
  upper_string = my_string.upper()  # "HELLO WORLD"
  ```

- **Splitting Strings:** Using the `split()` method to divide a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
  ```python
  my_string = "Hello World"
  words = my_string.split()  # ["Hello", "World"]
  ```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help in organizing code, reducing redundancy, and improving readability.

### Key Concepts:
- **Defining Functions:** Using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.
  ```python
  def greet(name):
      return f"Hello, {name}!"
  ```

- **Function Parameters:** Variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
  ```python
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```

- **Return Statement:** Using the `return` keyword to send the function's result back to the caller.
  ```python
  def square(x):
      return x * x
  ```

- **Calling Functions:** Executing a function by using its name followed by parentheses.
  ```python
  result = add(2, 3)  # 5
  ```

## Sets

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.

### Key Concepts:
- **Creating Sets:** Using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3}
  another_set = set([1, 2, 3, 3, 2])  # {1, 2, 3}
  ```

- **Adding Elements:** Using the `add()` method.
  ```python
  my_set.add(4)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}
  ```

- **Set Operations:** Including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set2 = {3, 4, 5}
  union = set1 | set2  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  ```

- **Membership Testing:** Checking if an element is in a set using the `in` keyword.
  ```python
  is_member = 3 in my_set  # True
  ```

## Tuples

A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation.

### Key Concepts:
- **Creating Tuples:** Using parentheses `()` or the `tuple()` function.
  ```python
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
  another_tuple = tuple([1, 2, 3])  # (1, 2, 3)
  ```

- **Accessing Elements:** Using indexing, similar to lists.
  ```python
  first_element = my_tuple[0]  # 1
  ```

- **Immutability:** Once created, elements of a tuple cannot be changed.
  ```python
  # my_tuple[0] = 4  # This will raise a TypeError
  ```

- **Tuple Methods:** Limited methods like `count()` and `index()`.
  ```python
  count_of_twos = my_tuple.count(2)  # 1
  index_of_three = my_tuple.index(3)  # 2
  ```

## Dictionaries

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are optimized for retrieving data when the key is known.

### Key Concepts:
- **Creating Dictionaries:** Using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs or the `dict()` function.
  ```python
  my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
  another_dict = dict(name="Bob", age=30)
  ```

- **Accessing Values:** Using keys inside square brackets `[]`.
  ```python
  name = my_dict["name"]  # "Alice"
  ```

- **Modifying Entries:** Changing values by assigning new values to existing keys.
  ```python
  my_dict["age"] = 26
  ```

- **Dictionary Methods:** Various methods such as `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, etc., for manipulating dictionaries.
  ```python
  keys = my_dict.keys()  # dict_keys(['name', 'age'])
  ```
